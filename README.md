# CarSharing_Report_with_SQL_Queries
## Overview
This repository contains SQL queries and documentation for analyzing a car-sharing dataset. The dataset includes information about customer demand, rates, weather conditions, and temperature data collected on an hourly basis between January 2017 and August 2018. Through this project, I explored various insights into demand patterns, weather influences, and other factors affecting car-sharing services.

## Files
-**SQL Queries**: Contains the SQL scripts used for data analysis.

-**Data Model**: Describes the structure of the car-sharing database, including table relationships.

-**ERD Diagram**: Entity-Relationship Diagram illustrating the connections between tables.

## Project Tasks and Queries
1. **Identify Peak Demand**
	
 -Find the date and time with the highest demand rate in 2017.

2. **Analyze Demand by Time Period**

-Create a table showing the name of the weekday, month, and season with the highest and lowest average demand in 2017. Include calculated averages.

3. **Hourly Demand Analysis**

-For the weekday(s) identified in task 2, show the average demand at different hours throughout 2017, sorted in descending order by demand.

4.	**Weather Analysis**

-Determine the weather trends for 2017: categorize into mostly cold, mild, or hot. Identify the most prevalent weather condition. Also, calculate the average, highest, and lowest wind speed and humidity for each month in 2017.
	
 5. **Compare Peak Demand Month**

-Compare the weather patterns of the month with the highest demand against other months, showing average demand across cold, mild, and hot weather conditions.

## Instructions

1.	Database Setup

  	 Create a database called carsharing and import the following tables:

 â€¢	CarSharing_df

 â€¢	Temperature
	
 â€¢	Weather

 â€¢	Time
 
2. Establish relationships between the tables, linking Temperature, Weather, and Time to the CarSharing_df table.
	
 3.	ERD Diagram
	
 â€¢	Visualize the relationships using an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD).
	
 4.	Google Sheets Integration

	â€¢	Organize query results in Google Sheets, with proper columns and conditions applied as instructed.
